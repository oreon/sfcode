        <p>
        Click on the "PayPal BUY NOW" button or the "DONATE" button to get transfered to the PayPal website to continue processing sample 
        transaction.<br/><br/>
        The BuyNow component posts to the PayPal Sandbox.  The Sandbox is a mirror of the real PayPal site where 
        real financial transactions aren't made. It is a safe testing environment used to test PayPal features such 
        as Website Payments. You will want to run in this mode until your website is operational and ready to be hosted on a 
        public domain. 
		I have replaced the Buy now components with images for the moment until we decide how we are going to implement this.
		The main beans used in the sun blueprints buy now component are in the src folder
		The blueprints tag library is in the web inf folder(bpui.tld)
